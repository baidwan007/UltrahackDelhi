# Main Files
The file having the code to convert these sockets into the usable form where we can embed our software inside it is broadlink_change_debug.py
We have changed this file in several ways so that the sockets that we have could be controlled by any software that we create on our local system and can later be sent to web.

#Server Files
Socket_scheduling_api.py is the main server file
